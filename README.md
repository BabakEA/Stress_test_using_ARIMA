# Stress_test_using_ARIMA


Apply stress test on infected population per Country 

To whom Interested in Stress testing using Time series theory:

Covid is a python application to predict the infected population for each Country per day. 

In this library, I used an interactive dashboard using Jupyter Widget, ARIMA, Seaborn, and JSON Libraries. The dataset is an open API that shows the number of infected, recovered, and dead populations per Country. 

A sample Dataset is added to the folder.

Dataset Source: https://pomber.github.io/covid19/timeseries.json

The Cohort report and VARIMA prediction will be added in the next version.
